Our artefact is an electronic educational game for children with special needs. 

The core game mechanic is based off of ‘Boggle’, a word game where players must find words within a grid of mixed letters under a time constraint.

To appease to a SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disability) demographic, our game provides users with extensive accessibility options, ranging from colourblind modes to functionality with disability-friendly controllers. 

Many children with special needs are unable to access the same content as those without special needs if the content does not have predefined options which allow them the same level of access.

For example, a user with dyslexia will have trouble playing Boggle, as it employs the use of close-knit letters. The same user playing our version can change the font size and style, allowing them to comfortably access the content.
